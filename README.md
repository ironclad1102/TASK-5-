# TASK-5-

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python. I used Jupyter Notebook to load and explore the data using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I applied basic functions like .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts() to understand the structure of the data. I then created visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, pairplots, and heatmaps to identify patterns and trends. Finally, I wrote observations for each chart and summarized my key findings at the end of the notebook.
